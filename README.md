# 🌍 Pixel Planet  

*A cozy, community-driven world-building experience — where pixels and people come together to create living worlds.*

---

## 🎨 Inspiration  
Pixel Planet was inspired by *r/Place* — the idea of people coming together to create something bigger than themselves.  
But instead of placing static pixels, we wanted players to *build entire worlds*.  
A place where anyone — even beginners — can shape *living, breathing pixel realms* and share them with others.  

---

## 🧩 What It Does  
Pixel Planet lets players *create, share, and explore* living pixel worlds together.  

- Start by using *globally shared assets, or craft your own with tools like the **pencil, eraser, line, and eyedropper*.  
- Save your creations *locally* or *share them globally* to inspire others.  
- Bring your world to life with *dynamic light, shadow, and atmospheric elements* that change over time — from calm evenings to glowing sunrises.  
- Explore creations from others, appreciate their creativity, and see who’s climbing the *global leaderboard*.  

Pixel Planet transforms collaborative creativity into an *ever-evolving shared universe* shaped by its community.

## ⚙ How We Built It  
Built with **[Devvit](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/devvit/)** and **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)**, Pixel Planet runs entirely on a **canvas-based rendering system**.  

- Implemented *chunking* for smooth performance, even in large worlds.  
- Fully optimized for *desktop and mobile*, ensuring seamless interactions and responsive controls.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced  
Performance was our biggest challenge — rendering light, shadow, and real-time drawing within the same canvas required significant optimization.  
We also worked hard to make the interface *intuitive and responsive* across all devices.  

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments We’re Proud Of  
- Built a *responsive and fully interactive editor* within a short timeframe.  
- Designed and optimized all tools and effects *from scratch*.  
- Created a system where every player can *build, share, and explore* effortlessly.
